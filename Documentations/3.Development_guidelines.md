## In Python

### How to write Models

The VCLS customization modules  are created in the src>user section of the home folder.

#### Template
```python
class aClass(models.Model):
    ''' [What it should represent]
    [Odoo name]
    [Extended comment on the function]
    '''
    YOUR CODE HERE
```
#### Example
```python
class Employee(models.Model):
    ''' An employee profile of the company
    [Odoo name] hr.employee
    [Comments]
	This is a class which is supposed
	to represent an employee within the company
    '''
    YOUR CODE HERE
```

### How to write new fields

#### Template
```python
    # [specific information about the field]
    aNewField = fields.aType(
		parameter1,
		parameter2)
```
#### Example
```python
    # Overwritten field
	name = fields.Char(
		string = â€™Nameâ€™,
		default = â€™defâ€™)
```

### How to write functions

#### Template
```python
    @api.depends('value')
    def function(a, b):
        ''' [What does it do briefly]
        [when should it be activated]
        [parameters]
        [used resources]
        [returned value]
        [Extended comment on the function]
        '''
        YOUR CODE HERE
```
#### Example
```python
    @api.depends('value')
    def sum(a, b):
    ''' Return the sum of a and b
    [when] when value is changed
    [in] a : number
	[in] b : number
    [use] none
    [return] a + b
	[return] b + a
    [Comments]
	This function return the sum
	of two numbers
    '''
    if (a>b):
 		return a + b
 	else:
		return b + a
```
