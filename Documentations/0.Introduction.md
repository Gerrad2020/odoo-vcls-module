The visual setting of the platform is customized via the vcls-theme module

The published applications are designed to provide a simple user interface to minimize the training needs of the platform.

The kanban view provides drag and drop functionality for selected group of fields.

Various filters per fields and groups can be applied to view a subset of records.

### Interfaces

There is an Azure AD interface implemented to enable SSO functionality. 
This is achieved via the userodoo_microsoft_account module with the oAuth protocol.

Email notification is implemented hence all users are notified via email for messages and assignment notifications unless their notification setting is changed.
